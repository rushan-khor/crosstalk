## What's the point of Crosstalk?

Crosstalk streams a Telegram group chat into a Slack channel.

Telegram is a great messaging app. Its delightful responsiveness makes it ideal for mobile texting on-the-go.

But your team's sticker-dominated Telegram chat isn't gonna hold up for serious work-related discussions. Serious discussions shold happen on ~~email threads~~ Slack channels. Yet, when you're on-the-go, no fun-loving person wants to keep the Slack mobile app open, at the expense of social-oriented Telegram, just for that one team chat.

Crosstalk thus streams your team's quirky Telegram group chat into a Slack channel, so you'll never have to context-switch into Slack's mobile app again just to keep the team conversation documented there.
